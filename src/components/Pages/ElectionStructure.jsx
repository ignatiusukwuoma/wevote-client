                  <p>Nigeria elects on the federal level a head of state (the President of Nigeria)
                      and a legislature (the National Assembly). The president is elected by the people.
                      The National Assembly has two chambers. The House of Representatives has 360 members,
                      elected for a four-year term in single-seat constituencies. The Senate has 109 members,
                      elected for a four-year term: each of the 36 states are divided into 3 senatorial districts,
                      each of which is represented by one senator; the Federal Capital Territory is represented by
                      only one senator.
                      Nigeria has a multi-party system, with two or three strong parties and a third party that is
                      electorally successful.
